        "question": "If a monkey always chooses the banana when offered both a banana and a rock, is it truly making a free choice?",
        "number": 1,
        "answers": ["Yes", "No", "Only sometimes", "Depends on the monkey"],
        "correct": "No",
        "explanation": "If the monkey's choice is entirely determined by instinct or prior conditioning, then it's not a truly free choice in the philosophical sense.",
        "hint": "Think about whether choices can exist without alternatives."

        "correct": "Only humans have ethics",
        "explanation": "Ethical frameworks are human constructs, and while animals show social behavior, they aren’t held to moral standards the way humans are.",

        "question": "If a monkey dreams it's in a jungle but is actually in a zoo, is its experience any less real to it?",
        "number": 3,
        "answers": ["Yes", "No", "Only after waking", "Dreams aren’t real"],
        "correct": "No",
        "explanation": "From a philosophical perspective (like Descartes or idealism), experiences in dreams can be subjectively real.",

        "answers": ["Yes", "No", "Both", "Neither"],
        "correct": "Neither",
        "explanation": "If the sign is true, then it must be false. But if it's false, then it's true. It's a classic paradox with no consistent answer.",

        "correct": "Yes",
        "explanation": "Though there are infinite steps, the total distance can be finite. This paradox challenges our understanding of motion and infinity.",

        "question": "A monkey shaves all monkeys who don’t shave themselves. Should he shave himself?",
        "number": 4,
        "answers": ["Yes", "No", "Only sometimes", "This is a paradox"],
        "correct": "This is a paradox",
        "explanation": "If he shaves himself, he shouldn’t. If he doesn’t, he should. It’s logically impossible — that's the paradox.",
        "hint": "It’s about self-reference — like a loop with no escape."
